zalun - 2010-02-17 - Saving dependencies
----------------------------------------
There is a problem with editing dependencies and saving them together 
with the main edited file. It just doesn't seem to work well to force 
user to use the same save action for all edited files.

What I suggest is to display a popUp onAnySave if any capability was changed.
Whithin that popUp there will be a list of changed elements. User will have 
an if item should be saved and in which way (new version/update).

The system is designed to connect saving of the model only if its content
has been changed - however it will to wait until proper onChange event will 
be written. Currently the system will send the onChange event after onBlur,
which may bring some problems. I guess using the BespinEmbedded will solve
this issue.
